/**
 * A windows application controlled by a Twin automation server.
 * <p>
 * An application is created and launched using an application name (which must match that on the server), an optional version number, 
 * and other optional parameters. When an application is closed, its process will be immediately terminated if still running, so it's better to 
 * shut it down cleanly. Note that when used in unit tests, the application will be opened before your test runs and closed after your test terminates.
 * <p>
 * At any given time, and application can have zero or more windows open. These can be listed with getWindows(). For the common case of a single window 
 * that appears shortly after the application is launched, getWindow() will wait for the window to appear and return it.
 * <p>
 * Window is a subclass of Element, and contain a tree of Elements representing the contents of the window. See {@link org.ebayopensource.twin.Element Element} for details of navigating 
 * this tree. There is also a special element called Desktop that contains all windows of your application.
 * <p>
 * The client makes several requests of the server when it launches: <dl>
 * <dt>Desired capabilities</dt>
 * <dd>These are key-value pairs describing how the application must be configured on the server.
 * When you call open(String appName, String version), this creates a default set of capabilities:
 * "applicationName"=appName, "version"=version. You can specify other capabilities by using the overloaded forms of open().</dd>
 * <dt>Session setup</dt>
 * <dd>These are key-object pairs describing what  the server should do before opening your session. 
 * For example, overwriting an application config file with one provided by the client. 
 * These may be ignored by the server, unless desired capabilities specify that they must be accepted. 
 * For example: "files"=[ {"path"="C:/config.txt", "data"="Base64DataHere"} ] would request the server to overwrite C:/config.txt 
 * with the provided data before running the test. <br>
 * By convention the desired capability "sessionSetup.files" should be set to "true" 
 * to indicate that this is required. You can specify session setup data by calling addSessionSetup(String, Object). The optional 
 * third parameter can be set to true to automatically set the corresponding desired capability.</dd>
 * </dl>
